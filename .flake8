# > In some cases, as determined by PEP 8, Black will enforce an equal amount of
# > whitespace around slice operators. Due to this, Flake8 will raise
# > `E203 whitespace before ':'` warnings. Since this warning is not PEP 8
# > compliant, Flake8 should be configured to ignore it via `extend-ignore = E203`.
#
# > Also, as like with isort, flake8 should be configured to allow lines up to
# > the length limit of 88, Blackâ€™s default. This explains `max-line-length = 88`.
